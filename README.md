# CS50 Code 2022

Code from the [CS50 MOOC 2022](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/) offered by Harvard. I followed the lectures and assignments but did not finish the project :( coz boards

Apparently the code was still up though in a private repo so I'm uploading it here.

It covers labs and assignments in:

0. Scratch (I skipped T_T)
1. C
2. Arrays
3. Algorithms
4. Memory
5. Data Structures
6. Python
7. SQL
8. HTML, CSS, JavaScript
9. Flask
10. Emoji

> since I copied and reuploaded source files here, they do not show git commit history F but 'tis just code

You may have to run `pip install cs50` to make the code work.
