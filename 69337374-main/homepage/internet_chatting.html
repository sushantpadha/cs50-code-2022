                    Common types of internet chatting are:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Instant Messaging: </strong>It is the most common way of chatting. It is text-based
                        communication. It happens between two people or groups of people.</li>
                    <li><strong>Internet Relay Chat: </strong>It is known as IRC. It is also a text-based chat. It is
                        not owned by any company and to use IRC we need a client program. Using IRC we can participate
                        in discussion channels or can communicate with only two partners or users.</li>
                    <li><strong>ICQ: </strong>It is known as I seek you. It is the most useful communication program.
                        Using ICQ we can send files, URLs, and more. It is just like instant messaging but allows you to
                        enter into the chat room and can chat with multiple people at a time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Voice Chatting: </strong>We can chat not only with text but also with sounds as well. It
                        is known as voice chatting. Voice chatting can be used with the internet just as a phone call.
                        Internet voice call is free and unlimited, it only needs a good internet connection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Video chatting: </strong>Video chatting is also a kind of chatting which is also done
                        with the help of the internet and it also requires a webcam as it is a face to face chatting.
                        Internet speed required by video chatting is higher as compared to text and video chatting. And
                        a good quality camera too.</li>
